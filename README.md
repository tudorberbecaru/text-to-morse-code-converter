# text-to-morse-code-converter
As a child, I was always fascinated by the mysterious world of Morse code and its use in communication. I often imagined building a Morse code encoder/decoder, and now, I've turned that childhood dream into reality.

This Python program allows you to easily convert text into Morse code and vice versa.

### Features:

**Text to Morse Code Encoding:** Input any text, and the program will translate it into Morse code. It handles letters, numbers, and common punctuation, making it practical for encoding various messages.<br />
**Morse Code to Text Decoding:** Enter Morse code with '.' and '-' for encoding, using spaces between letters and slashes between words. The program decodes the Morse code into readable text.<br />
**Error Handling:** The program gracefully handles invalid Morse code input and untranslatable characters.<br />
**User-Friendly Interface:** A straightforward command-line interface ensures a user-friendly experience.<br />

Feel free to adjust and expand upon this program to suit your needs :)
